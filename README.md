Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning - README
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the closing price of a stock 5 trading days into the future using historical stock price data. We applied multiple machine learning models, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineered features, and selected the most appropriate model based on predictive accuracy and practical trading value.

Key Steps in the Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We explored the stock price dataset by visualizing the trends, distribution, and correlations between key features such as 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Volume'.
We identified temporal patterns, seasonality, and anomalies in the stock data, which were important for feature engineering.
Feature selection was done based on the correlation with the 'Close' price and their relevance to predictive modeling.
Feature Engineering:

Features like 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Volume' were selected based on their relationship with the target variable ('Close').
We created time-based features like the day of the week and month to capture any cyclical behavior in stock prices.
Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, scaling the 'Close' prices using MinMaxScaler, and setting the 'Date' column as the index.
Modeling:

We tested several machine learning models: Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and XGBoost.
The models were evaluated using performance metrics such as MSE, RMSE, R-squared (RÂ²), and MAPE to determine their effectiveness in predicting future stock prices.
After comparing the models, the LSTM model was selected as the final model due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies and trends in stock prices.
Evaluation:

The models were evaluated on statistical metrics to assess the predictive accuracy. The LSTM model outperformed the other models and provided the best results for predicting the next 5 days' closing prices.
Key Findings
Trend and Seasonality: The data exhibited significant trends and seasonality, which were essential for model training.
Feature Importance: Features like 'Open', 'High', and 'Low' prices were highly correlated with the 'Close' price, making them crucial for prediction.
Model Performance: LSTM showed the best performance among all models, capturing temporal dependencies and long-term trends in stock prices. However, LSTM is computationally expensive and requires a large amount of data.
Data Preprocessing: Proper data preprocessing, including handling missing data and normalizing prices, played a critical role in improving model performance.

2. Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a historical stock price dataset. It can be downloaded from various financial data sources like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.

The dataset should have the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock data.
Open: The stock's opening price.
High: The highest price the stock reached during the trading day.
Low: The lowest price the stock reached during the trading day.
Close: The stock's closing price.
Volume: The number of shares traded during the day
